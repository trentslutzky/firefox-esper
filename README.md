# Firefox esper Theme
Custom firefox css styling to match the rest of my linux deskrop environment (esper)

### features:

- Minimal ui that only shows what you regularly need to see
- Modern squared-off design
- Transparency
- Grayscale icons for theme uniformity
- Better (and more animated) container indicators
- URL bar above tab bar because I like it better that way
- The font comes from my GTK theme (JetBrainsMono Nerd Font)
- Only show the tab close button on the active tab

also includes a user.js file for automatically configuring some firefox graphical settings (I don't know if it actually does anything)
